# ActionScript 3 NullPointerException in Asynchronous Data Loading

This repository demonstrates a common ActionScript 3 error: a `NullPointerException` arising from accessing a property of an object that might be null, particularly in the context of asynchronous data loading.  The `BuggyDataLoading.as` file shows the problematic code, while `FixedDataLoading.as` offers a corrected version.

The core issue stems from the asynchronous nature of data retrieval.  If the data hasn't loaded before the property access attempt, the object reference will be null, leading to the exception. The solution involves checking for null before accessing the property.

**Key Learning:** Always check for null references before accessing properties, especially when dealing with asynchronous operations or external data sources.
